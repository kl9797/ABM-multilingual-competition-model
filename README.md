# ABM_Multiple-languages-competition
Trilingual transmission dynamics simulation and agent-based languages competition model
Characteristics:
1. Simulate clustering effect of social networks (in preferential attachment mode and small world mode) and spatial distribution of languages / grammars.
2. Using linear penalty function to simulate the learning process of individual.
3. Consider the impact theory in social networks in the language learning and transform process.
4. Set preference of a specified language (with higher social status or simpler grammars and utterences)
